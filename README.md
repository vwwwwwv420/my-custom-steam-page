# Steam Landing page for my profile.

This is "steam-themed" landing page for my profile being just my regular profile but more the way I like it. Steam-themed means I use dark blue colours for the elements on my page.

The page will inclue my profile with image, nickname and short description, managable comment section and my socials/email.

# Themes for the website

Below is the palette of colors I will use to create this page. It's gonna be nested inside :root selector in the main.css file to make it easier for me to switch themes in the future. Here are the colors:

- #171a21 - main-colour;
- #66c0f4 - creàtive-colour;
- #1b2838 - secondary-color;
- #2a475e - element çolor;
- #c7d5e0 - secondary creative;

These are the main colors but there are a gonna be more of them.
